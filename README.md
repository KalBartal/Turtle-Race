# Turtle Race

This is my coding challenge submission for day #19 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is application uses Python's Turtle Graphics for a randomised turtle race where each turtle has a different colour from a list of colours.

As the application starts, the user can bet on a turtle of their choice to win the race. Then the race start and at the end a winner is declared.
